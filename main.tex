\section*{Solutions}

\subsection*{Question 1, Section 2, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent We have a zero-coupon bond that pays \$1000 in 10 years.  
If the annual effective yield rate is $i$, the price $P$ is
\[
  P = \frac{1000}{(1+i)^{10}}.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $i = 0.10$,
  \[
    P_{10\%} = \frac{1000}{1.10^{10}}
      \approx \frac{1000}{2.59374246}
      \approx 385.54.
  \]
  So the price is approximately \$385.54.

  \item For $i = 0.09$,
  \[
    P_{9\%} = \frac{1000}{1.09^{10}}
      \approx \frac{1000}{2.366531}
      \approx 422.41.
  \]
  So the price is approximately \$422.41.

  \item The percentage increase in price when the yield drops from 10\% to 9\% is
  \[
    \frac{P_{9\%} - P_{10\%}}{P_{10\%}} \times 100\%
      = \frac{422.41 - 385.54}{385.54}\times 100\%
      \approx 9.56\%.
  \]
  \end {enumerate}

\subsection*{Question 3, Section 2, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent A 26-week T-bill is bought for \$9600 and matures at \$10\,000.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Discount rate (T-bill convention).}

  The bank discount rate $d$ uses a 360-day year and the face value in the denominator:
  \[
    d
      = \frac{F - P}{F} \cdot \frac{360}{\text{days to maturity}}.
  \]
  With $F = 10000$, $P = 9600$, and $26$ weeks $\approx 182$ days,
  \[
    d
      = \frac{10000-9600}{10000} \cdot \frac{360}{182}
      = 0.04 \cdot \frac{360}{182}
      \approx 0.0791.
  \]
  So the annual discount rate is about $7.91\%$.

  \item \textbf{Annual effective yield rate.}

  The holding-period yield over half a year is
  \[
    i_{0.5} = \frac{F}{P} - 1 = \frac{10000}{9600} - 1 = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.041667.
  \]
  The annual effective yield is
  \[
    i_{\text{eff}}
      = (1 + i_{0.5})^2 - 1
      = \left(\frac{25}{24}\right)^2 - 1
      \approx 1.08507 - 1
      \approx 0.0851.
  \]
  So the annual effective rate is approximately $8.51\%$.
\end{enumerate}

   \subsection*{Question 5, Section 3, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent  Both bonds have par value \$1000, the same maturity, and yield a nominal
rate of 4\% convertible semiannually.  
Thus the yield per half-year is
\[
  j = \frac{0.04}{2} = 0.02.
\]

Let $n$ be the number of half-year periods to maturity.

\medskip
\textbf{Step 1: Determine $n$ from the first bond.}

First bond: coupon rate 5\% nominal payable semiannually.  
Coupon per half-year:
\[
  C_1 = \frac{0.05}{2} \cdot 1000 = 25.
\]
Its price is \$1136.78, so
\[
  1136.78
    = 25\,a_{\angl{n}}^{(j)} + 1000(1+j)^{-n},
\]
where
\[
  a_{\angl{n}}^{(j)} = \frac{1-(1+j)^{-n}}{j}.
\]

Solving this equation numerically gives
\[
  n \approx 40.
\]
Thus the term is about $40$ half-year periods, or $20$ years.

\medskip
\textbf{Step 2: Price of the second bond.}

Second bond: coupon rate $2\tfrac12\%$ nominal, payable semiannually.  
Coupon per half-year:
\[
  C_2 = \frac{0.025}{2} \cdot 1000 = 12.50.
\]

At the same yield $j=0.02$ and with $n=40$,
\[
  P_2 = 12.5\,a_{\angl{40}}^{(0.02)} + 1000(1.02)^{-40}.
\]

Compute:
\[
  a_{\angl{40}}^{(0.02)} = \frac{1-1.02^{-40}}{0.02},
\]
so numerically
\[
  P_2 \approx 794.83.
\]

Therefore, the price of the second bond is approximately \$794.83.

   \subsection*{Question 8, Section 3, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent Current yield rates are 7\% nominal convertible semiannually, so the
yield per half-year is
\[
  j = \frac{0.07}{2} = 0.035.
\]

\medskip
\textbf{Step 1: Price received for the existing 10\% bond.}

Par value \$1000; coupon rate 10\% nominal, semiannual coupons.  
Coupon per half-year:
\[
  C_1 = \frac{0.10}{2}\cdot 1000 = 50.
\]
The bond has 10 years to maturity, i.e.\ $n_1 = 20$ half-year periods.

The price is
\[
  P_1 = 50\,a_{\angl{20}}^{(0.035)} + 1000(1.035)^{-20}.
\]

With
\[
  a_{\angl{20}}^{(0.035)} = \frac{1-1.035^{-20}}{0.035},
\]
we find
\[
  P_1 \approx 1213.19.
\]

\medskip
\textbf{Step 2: Par value of the new 6\% bond.}

Let $X$ be the par value of the new bond.  
Coupon rate 6\% nominal, semiannual coupons, so coupon per period is
\[
  C_2 = \frac{0.06}{2} X = 0.03X.
\]
The new bond has 8 years to maturity, i.e.\ $n_2 = 16$ half-year periods,
and is priced to yield the same $j=0.035$.

So its price is
\[
  P_2 = 0.03X\,a_{\angl{16}}^{(0.035)} + X(1.035)^{-16}.
\]

All proceeds from selling the old bond are used to buy this new bond, so
\[
  P_2 = P_1.
\]
Thus
\[
  0.03X\,a_{\angl{16}}^{(0.035)} + X(1.035)^{-16} = 1213.19.
\]

Factor $X$:
\[
  X\left[0.03\,a_{\angl{16}}^{(0.035)} + (1.035)^{-16}\right] = 1213.19.
\]

Compute the bracketed term:
\[
  a_{\angl{16}}^{(0.035)} = \frac{1-1.035^{-16}}{0.035},
\]
and numerically
\[
  0.03\,a_{\angl{16}}^{(0.035)} + (1.035)^{-16} \approx 0.9394.
\]

Therefore
\[
  X = \frac{1213.19}{0.9394} \approx 1291.27.
\]

So the par value of the 8-year bond is approximately \$1291.27.

subsection*{Question 10, Section 3, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent We use the data from Example 6.3:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F &= 1000, \\
C &= 1050, \\
\text{coupon rate} &= 8.4\% \text{ nominal, semiannual}, \\
r &= \frac{0.084}{2} = 0.042, \\
\text{coupon each half-year} &= Fr = 1000(0.042)=42, \\
i &= \frac{0.10}{2}=0.05\quad \text{(yield per half-year)},\\
n &= 20 \quad\text{(10 years, semiannual)}, \\
K &= 1050(1.05)^{-20} = 395.7340, \\
G &= \frac{0.042}{0.05}(1000)=840.
\end{aligned}
\]

The price (computed in Example 6.3) is
\[
P = 919.15.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{(a) Nominal yield based on par value}

\[
\text{Nominal yield on par} = \frac{\text{annual coupon}}{\text{par value}}
= \frac{0.084\cdot 1000}{1000} = 0.084 = 8.4\%.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{(b) Nominal yield based on redemption value}

\[
\text{Nominal yield on redemption value}
  = \frac{\text{annual coupon}}{\text{redemption value}}
  = \frac{84}{1050}
  = 0.08 = 8\%.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{(c) Current yield}

\[
\text{Current yield} = \frac{\text{annual coupon}}{P}
= \frac{84}{919.15}
\approx 0.0914
= 9.14\%.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{(d) Yield to maturity}

The yield to maturity was given in Example 6.3 as 10\% nominal convertible semiannually, i.e.
\[
i_{\text{YTM}} = 10\% \quad \text{(nominal, convertible semiannually)}.
\]

The effective annual yield corresponding to this is
\[
i_{\text{eff}} = (1.05)^2 - 1 = 0.1025 = 10.25\%.
\]

\bigskip
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)}\;& 8.4\% \\
\text{(b)}\;& 8\% \\
\text{(c)}\;& 9.14\% \\
\text{(d)}\;& \text{YTM} = 10\% \text{ nominal (convertible semiannually)}
\end{aligned}}
\]

    \subsection*{Question 11, Section 4, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent Consider a \$1 par bond with yield rate per period $i$ and $n$ periods
to redemption.

Let $a_{\angl{n}}$ denote the present value of an $n$-period annuity
immediate at rate $i$:
\[
  a_{\angl{n}} = \frac{1-v^n}{i}, \qquad v = \frac{1}{1+i}.
\]

We use the standard identity for a par bond:
\[
  i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n = 1.   \tag{$\ast$}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{First bond.}

Coupon rate is $1.5i$ (150\% of the yield rate) on par 1, so coupon per
period is $1.5i$.

Price $P_1$:
\[
  P_1 = 1.5i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n = 1 + p.
\]

Using $(\ast)$, we write
\[
  P_1 = 1.5i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n
      = (i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n) + 0.5i\,a_{\angl{n}}
      = 1 + 0.5i\,a_{\angl{n}}.
\]
Hence
\[
  1 + p = 1 + 0.5i\,a_{\angl{n}}
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  p = 0.5\,i\,a_{\angl{n}}.
\]
Therefore
\[
  i\,a_{\angl{n}} = 2p.
\]

\medskip
\textbf{Second bond.}

Coupon rate is $0.75i$ (75\% of the yield rate) on par 1, so coupon per
period is $0.75i$.

Price $P_2$:
\[
  P_2 = 0.75i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n.
\]
Again using $(\ast)$,
\[
  P_2 = (i\,a_{\angl{n}} + v^n) - 0.25i\,a_{\angl{n}}
      = 1 - 0.25i\,a_{\angl{n}}.
\]

Substitute $i\,a_{\angl{n}} = 2p$:
\[
  P_2 = 1 - 0.25\cdot 2p = 1 - \frac{p}{2}.
\]

\textbf{Hence, the price of the second bond as a function of $p$ is}
\[
  \boxed{P_2 = 1 - \dfrac{p}{2}}.
\]

\subsection*{Question 13, Section 4, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent We are given:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A 10-year bond with semiannual coupons $\Rightarrow n = 20$ coupon periods.
    \item Yield rate: $9\%$ nominal convertible semiannually $\Rightarrow i = 0.09/2 = 0.045$ per period.
    \item The bond is bought at a \emph{discount}, so the book value is increasing.
    \item The amount of accumulation of discount in the next-to-last coupon (period 19) is \$8.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\textbf{Key fact from amortization theory:}

For a bond bought at a discount, the \emph{accumulation of discount} in period $t$ is
\[
D_t = i(B_t - C/i)
\]
but more simply, for a bond amortized by the \emph{constant-yield method}, the sequence of discount accumulations satisfies
\[
D_t = D_1(1+i)^{\,t-1}.
\]

We are told that
\[
D_{19} = 8.
\]

Thus,
\[
D_{19} = D_1(1.045)^{18} = 8.
\]

\textbf{Solve for $D_1$:}
\[
D_1 = \frac{8}{(1.045)^{18}}.
\]

Compute:
\[
(1.045)^{18} \approx 2.208039,
\qquad
D_1 \approx \frac{8}{2.208039} \approx 3.625.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{We need total accumulation of discount during the first four years.}

Four years means $8$ semiannual periods.

Thus,
\[
\text{Total discount accumulated in periods 1--8}
= \sum_{t=1}^{8} D_t
= D_1 \sum_{t=0}^{7} (1.045)^t.
\]

The geometric sum is
\[
\sum_{t=0}^{7} (1.045)^t = \frac{1.045^{8} - 1}{0.045}.
\]

Compute:
\[
1.045^8 \approx 1.42328,
\qquad
\frac{1.42328 - 1}{0.045} \approx \frac{0.42328}{0.045} \approx 9.4062.
\]

Therefore,
\[
\text{Total discount} = D_1 (9.4062) \approx 3.625(9.4062) \approx 34.11.
\]

\bigskip
\[
\boxed{\text{Total accumulation of discount in the first four years } \approx \$34.11.}
\]

   \subsection*{Question 14, Section 4, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent We are given:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Par value: $F = 1000$.
    \item Term: 5 years with semiannual coupons $\Rightarrow n = 10$ periods.
    \item Coupon rate: $10\%$ nominal, semiannual.
          Thus coupon each period:
          \[
            C = \frac{0.10}{2} \cdot 1000 = 50.
          \]
    \item Yield rate: $12\%$ nominal, convertible semiannually.
          Thus yield per period:
          \[
            i = \frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06.
          \]
    \item The bond is redeemable at par at maturity.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\textbf{Price of the bond.}

\[
P = 50\,a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.06)} + 1000(1.06)^{-10}.
\]

Compute:
\[
a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.06)} = \frac{1-1.06^{-10}}{0.06}
= \frac{1-0.558394}{0.06}
= 7.3601.
\]

Thus:
\[
50(7.3601) = 368.005,
\]
\[
1000(1.06)^{-10} = 1000(0.558394) = 558.394.
\]

Therefore:
\[
P = 368.005 + 558.394 = 926.399.
\]
So the purchase price is approximately
\[
P \approx 926.40.
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{Total interest paid (total yield interest).}

In the amortization schedule, “interest paid” each period equals:
\[
\text{Interest}_t = i \cdot B_{t-1},
\]
where $B_{t-1}$ is the beginning book value.

But the \emph{sum} of all interest entries in the amortization schedule has a standard closed-form:

\[
\text{Total interest paid}
= (F - P).
\]

This identity follows because, over the life of a bond under constant yield amortization,
\[
\text{Total coupon payments}
= \text{Accumulated discount} + \text{Interest paid},
\]
and ending book value equals redemption value.

More directly:
\[
\text{Total yield interest}
= \sum_{t=1}^{n} i B_{t-1}
= F - P.
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Total interest paid}
= 1000 - 926.40 = 73.60.
\]

\bigskip
\[
\boxed{\text{Total interest paid in the amortization schedule } \approx \$73.60.}
\]

\subsection*{Question 16, Section 4, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

\noindent \textbf{Given tables:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Table 6.2: Bond amortization schedule for a \$1000 two-year bond with 8\% semiannual coupons, bought to yield 6\% semiannually. \\
    Premium amortized each period (true values): 8.88,\; 9.15,\; 9.43,\; 9.71.
    \item Table 6.3: Bond amortization schedule for the same bond bought to yield 10\% semiannually. \\
    Discount accumulated each period (true values): 8.23,\; 8.64,\; 9.07,\; 9.52.
\end{itemize}

For both tables the number of periods is $n = 4$.

The straight-line method distributes the \emph{total premium} or \emph{total discount} evenly over all periods.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(a) Straight-line book values for Table 6.2}

From Table 6.2:

\[
\text{Total premium amortized} = 37.17.
\]

Straight-line amortization per period:

\[
A = \frac{37.17}{4} = 9.2925.
\]

Book values under straight-line:

\[
B_t = B_0 - tA,
\qquad B_0 = 1037.17.
\]

Thus:

\[
\begin{aligned}
B_1 &= 1037.17 - 9.2925 = 1027.8775, \\
B_2 &= 1037.17 - 2(9.2925) = 1018.5850, \\
B_3 &= 1037.17 - 3(9.2925) = 1009.2925, \\
B_4 &= 1037.17 - 4(9.2925) = 1000.00.
\end{aligned}
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(b) Straight-line book values for Table 6.3}

From Table 6.3:

\[
\text{Total discount accumulated} = 35.46.
\]

Straight-line discount accumulation per period:

\[
A = \frac{35.46}{4} = 8.865.
\]

Book values under straight-line:

\[
B_t = B_0 + tA,
\qquad B_0 = 964.54.
\]

Thus:

\[
\begin{aligned}
B_1 &= 964.54 + 8.865 = 973.405, \\
B_2 &= 964.54 + 2(8.865) = 982.270, \\
B_3 &= 964.54 + 3(8.865) = 991.135, \\
B_4 &= 964.54 + 4(8.865) = 1000.00.
\end{aligned}
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(c) Comparison with the true values}

\textbf{Table 6.2 (premium case):}

Straight-line amortization ($9.2925$ per period) differs from the true amortization (8.88, 9.15, 9.43, 9.71).  
The true premium amortization \emph{increases} each period, whereas straight-line keeps it constant.

Thus, straight-line book values are:
\[
B_t^{\text{SL}} \;\text{slightly above early true values and slightly below later true values.}
\]

\textbf{Table 6.3 (discount case):}

Straight-line discount accumulation ($8.865$ per period) differs from true values (8.23, 8.64, 9.07, 9.52).  
The true discount accumulation \emph{increases} each period, while straight-line keeps it constant.

Thus, straight-line book values:
\[
B_t^{\text{SL}} \;\text{underestimate early true values and overestimate later true values.}
\]

\bigskip
\textbf{Conclusion:}  
The straight-line method does not accurately follow the true pattern of book values because the constant-yield method causes amortization to change each period. Straight-line values are only approximate, not exact.

\subsection*{Question 18, Section 5, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}
    The bond has 8\% coupons semiannually, yield 10\% convertible semiannually.

\[
C = 40, \qquad i = 0.10/2 = 0.05.
\]

Purchase occurs at half-year \(0\), book value:
\[
B_0 = 964.54.
\]

Two months after purchase = \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac13 \) of a coupon period.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(1) Accrued interest}

Accrued interest is proportional to time since last coupon:

\[
\text{Accrued interest}
= C \cdot \frac{2}{6}
= 40 \cdot \frac13
= 13.\overline{3}.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(2) Flat price (clean price)}

Flat price = Present value at purchase of future payments grown forward for 2 months \emph{excluding} accrued interest.

Using constant yield accumulation from book value \(B_0\):

\[
\text{Flat price}
= B_0(1.05)^{2/6}.
\]

Compute:
\[
1.05^{1/3} \approx 1.01639.
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Flat price} = 964.54(1.01639) \approx 980.33.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{(3) Market price (dirty price)}

\[
\text{Dirty price} = \text{Flat price} + \text{Accrued interest}.
\]

\[
\text{Dirty price} = 980.33 + 13.33 = 993.66.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{Accrued interest} &\approx 13.33, \\
\text{Flat price} &\approx 980.33, \\
\text{Market (dirty) price} &\approx 993.66.

\subsection*{Question 19, Section 5, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

Coupon rate \(i^{(2)} = 6\%\) so coupon per half-year:

Yield is \(j = 7\%/2 = 0.035\) per half-year.

Redemption at par on October 15, year \(Z+15\).  
Purchase on June 28, year \(Z\).

Coupon dates each April 15 and October 15.

June 28 to October 15 = exact day count:

Total:

Fraction of period:

\subsection*{Present value at next coupon date}

Remaining payments:
- Coupons: 30 each half-year

Number of remaining coupons = 15.

Value one period before purchase (at Oct 15):

\[
V = 30 a_{\angl{15}}^{(0.035)} + 1000(1.035)^{-15}.
\]

Compute:

\[
a_{\angl{15}}^{(0.035)} = \frac{1-1.035^{-15}}{0.035} \approx 11.1856,
\]
\[
30(11.1856) = 335.57,
\]
\[
1000(1.035)^{-15} = 1000(0.61901) = 619.01.

So:
\[
V = 335.57 + 619.01 = 954.58.

\subsection*{Present value on June 28}

Discount back for fraction \(t=0.5951\) of a period:

Both bonds yield the same rate \(i\) per half-year.  
Let there be 40 periods (20 years, semiannual).

Par = 500, coupon = 45 annually → 22.5 per half-year.

Bond B:  
Par = 1000, coupon = 30 annually → 15 per half-year.

Premium on A = 2 × discount on B.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Step 1: Price equations}

Bond A price:
\[
P_A = 22.5 a_{\angl{40}}^{(i)} + 500v^{40}.
\]

Par − price = discount or premium:
\[
\text{Premium}_A = P_A - 500.
\]

Bond B:
\[
P_B = 15 a_{\angl{40}}^{(i)} + 1000v^{40}.

\subsection*{Step 2: Substitute}

\[
22.5 a + 500v^{40} - 500

Expand:
\[
22.5a + 500v^{40} - 500

Bring terms together:
\[
22.5a + 30a = 2000 + 500 -2000v^{40} - 500v^{40}.
\]

\[
52.5a = 2500 - 2500v^{40}.

\[
a = \frac{2500(1 - v^{40})}{52.5}.

Set equal:

\[
\frac{1-v^{40}}{i}

Let $i$ be the annual effective yield and $n$ the term in years.

Coupon each year:

Price with coupon rate 4.20\%:
\[
P = 42\,a_n + 1000v^n,

where $v = (1+i)^{-1}$ and
\[
a_n = \frac{1-v^n}{i}.
\]

\textbf{(ii) gives a relation between $a_n$ and $v^n$.}

PV of coupons equals PV of redemption:
\[
42a_n = 1000v^n \quad\Rightarrow\quad v^n = \frac{42}{1000}a_n.
\tag{1}

\textbf{(i) uses a 5.25\% coupon rate.}

New coupon: $C' = 0.0525\cdot 1000 = 52.5$.  
New price:
\[
P' = 52.5a_n + 1000v^n.

We are told $P' = P + 100$:
\[
52.5a_n + 1000v^n = 42a_n + 1000v^n + 100
   \quad\Rightarrow\quad
10.5a_n = 100
   \quad\Rightarrow\quad
a_n = \frac{100}{10.5} = \frac{200}{21}.

From (1):
\[
v^n = \frac{42}{1000}\cdot\frac{200}{21}
     = \frac{8400}{21000} = 0.4.

\textbf{Now solve for $i$.}

Using $a_n = \dfrac{1-v^n}{i}$ with $a_n = \dfrac{200}{21}$ and $v^n=0.4$:
\[
\frac{200}{21} = \frac{1-0.4}{i}

\textbf{(a) Price to yield 6\% convertible semiannually.}

Nominal 6\% $\Rightarrow j = 0.06/2 = 0.03$ per half-year.

For a callable bond where coupon rate $> $ yield, the issuer will call at the
\emph{earliest} date, so we assume a 10-year maturity: $n=20$ periods.

\[
P_{6\%} = 40\frac{1-(1.03)^{-20}}{0.03} + 1000(1.03)^{-20}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
P_{6\%} \approx 1148.77.
\]

\[
\boxed{P \approx \$1148.77.}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{(b) Price to yield 10\% convertible semiannually.}

Now $j = 0.10/2 = 0.05$.

Here coupon rate $< $ yield, so the call is \emph{favorable} to the investor:
worst case is the \emph{latest} call date, year 15 ($n=30$ periods).

\[
P_{10\%} = 40\frac{1-(1.05)^{-30}}{0.05} + 1000(1.05)^{-30}
   \approx 846.28.
\]

\[
\boxed{P \approx \$846.28.}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{(c) If the bond in (b) is actually called at the end of 10 years,
find the yield rate.}

Price is still \$846.28 (from part (b)).
Now redemption occurs after 10 years, so $n=20$ periods and we solve for $j$:

\[
846.28 = 40\frac{1-(1+j)^{-20}}{j} + 1000(1+j)^{-20}.
\]

Solving numerically gives
\[
j \approx 0.05261.
\]

The nominal yield convertible semiannually is
\[
2j \approx 0.1052.
\]

\[
\boxed{\text{Yield} \approx 10.52\% \text{ nominal, convertible semiannually.}}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{(d) If the bond is puttable rather than callable, rework (a).}

For a puttable bond, the \emph{investor} chooses the redemption time, so the
price is the \emph{maximum} of the prices based on possible put dates.

At yield 6\% ($j=0.03$):

\[
P_{10} = 40\frac{1-(1.03)^{-20}}{0.03} + 1000(1.03)^{-20}
   \approx 1148.77,
\]
\[
P_{15} = 40\frac{1-(1.03)^{-30}}{0.03} + 1000(1.03)^{-30}
   \approx 1196.00.
\]

The investor can do at least as well as the larger of these, so

\[
\boxed{P_{\text{put},6\%} \approx \$1196.00.}
\]

\medskip
\textbf{(e) If the bond is puttable rather than callable, rework (b).}

Now yield 10\% ($j=0.05$).  Compute both possible put dates:

\[
P_{10} = 40\frac{1-(1.05)^{-20}}{0.05} + 1000(1.05)^{-20}
   \approx 875.38,
\]
\[
P_{15} = 40\frac{1-(1.05)^{-30}}{0.05} + 1000(1.05)^{-30}
   \approx 846.28.
\]

The investor can realize the larger of the two, so

\[
\boxed{P_{\text{put},10\%} \approx \$875.38.}
\]


\subsection*{Question 25, Section 7, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

Par \$1000, 8\% nominal with quarterly coupons.

Coupon each quarter:
\[
C = 1000\cdot\frac{0.08}{4} = 20.
\]

Bond matures for \$1000 in 10 years:
\[
n = 10\times 4 = 40 \text{ quarters}.
\]

Yield is 6\% nominal convertible quarterly:
\[
j = 0.06/4 = 0.015.
\]

\textbf{Step 1: Price under 10-year maturity assumption (no call).}

\[
P = 20\frac{1-(1.015)^{-40}}{0.015} + 1000(1.015)^{-40}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
P \approx 1149.58.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Solve for redemption value $X$ if bond is called at 5 years.}

Callable at end of year 5 (20 quarters) with unknown redemption value $X$.
Under same yield $j$, price must still be $P$:

\[
P = 20\frac{1-(1.015)^{-20}}{0.015} + X(1.015)^{-20}.
\]

Solve for $X$:
\[
X = \frac{P - 20\frac{1-(1.015)^{-20}}{0.015}}{(1.015)^{-20}}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
X \approx 1085.84.
\]

\[
\boxed{\text{Redemption value at year 5} \approx \$1086\ \text{(nearest dollar).}}
\]


\subsection*{Question 26, Section 7, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

Par \$1000, 4\% nominal with semiannual coupons.

Coupon per half-year:
\[
C = 1000\cdot\frac{0.04}{2} = 20.
\]

Yield required: 5\% nominal convertible semiannually:
\[
j = 0.05/2 = 0.025.
\]

Bond matures in 10 years ($n = 20$ periods) and is callable at

\begin{itemize}
  \item \$1050 at the ends of years 4–6 ($n=8,10,12$),
  \item \$1025 at the ends of years 7–9 ($n=14,16,18$),
  \item \$1000 at the end of year 10 ($n=20$).
\end{itemize}

Since the coupon rate (4\%) is less than the desired yield (5\%), the bond
sells at a \emph{discount}.  Early call at a price near or above par is
favorable to the investor (gives extra capital earlier), so the \emph{worst}
case for the investor (lowest yield) is the \emph{latest} possible call date.

Thus to guarantee at least 5\%, we assume maturity in 10 years at \$1000.

Price corresponding to yield 5\% nominal (i.e.\ $j=0.025$) and $n=20$:

\[
P = 20\frac{1-(1.025)^{-20}}{0.025} + 1000(1.025)^{-20}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
P \approx 922.05.
\]

\[
\boxed{\text{Maximum price to guarantee 5\%} \approx \$922.05.}
\]


\subsection*{Question 27, Section 7, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

Par \$1000, coupon rate 9\% nominal with semiannual coupons.

Coupon per half-year:
\[
C = 1000\cdot\frac{0.09}{2} = 45.
\]

Bond is called for \$1100.  
It is bought for \$918 immediately after a coupon and then held to call.

Yield is 10\% nominal convertible semiannually, so
\[
j = 0.10/2 = 0.05
\]
per half-year.

Let $n$ be the number of half-year periods the bond is held.  
Then the price satisfies:

\[
918 = 45\frac{1-(1.05)^{-n}}{0.05} + 1100(1.05)^{-n}.
\]

Solve for $n$ numerically:

\[
n \approx 49.35\ \text{half-years}.
\]

Years held:
\[
t = \frac{n}{2} \approx \frac{49.35}{2} \approx 24.68\ \text{years}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[
\boxed{\text{Number of years held} \approx 25.}
\]


\subsection*{Question 28, Section 7, Chapter 6  (\cite{toi3rd})}

Par \$1000, annual coupons \$80, redeemable at par in 30 years.
Callable any time from the end of the 10th year at \$1050.

Based on a desired yield rate $r$, the investor computed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If called at year 10: \(P_{10} = 957\).
  \item If held to maturity (30 years): \(P_{30} = 897\).
\end{itemize}

He buys at the highest price that guarantees the desired yield regardless
of call time, i.e.
\[
P = \min(957, 897) = 897.
\]

The bond is actually called at year 20.  We must find the \emph{realized}
annual effective yield $i$ given:

\[
897 = 80\,a_{20}^{(i)} + 1050(1+i)^{-20},
\]
where
\[
a_{20}^{(i)} = \frac{1-(1+i)^{-20}}{i}.
\]

Solve numerically for $i$:

\[
i \approx 0.09243.
\]

Thus the investor earns an annual effective yield of about $9.24\%$.

\[
\boxed{\text{Realized annual yield} \approx 9.24\%.}
\]


\subsection*{Question 1, Section 2, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}

A ten–year project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Initial investment at $t=0$: $-100{,}000$.
  \item Maintenance expenses at beginning of each year (times $t=1,\dots,10$):
        \[
        M_1 = 3000,\qquad
        M_t = 3000(1.06)^{t-1}.
        \]
  \item Returns at end of each year (times $t=1,\dots,10$):
        \[
        R_1 = 30000,\qquad
        R_t = 30000(0.96)^{t-1}.
        \]
\end{itemize}

We compute the NPV at $i=6\%$:
\[
R_6 = -100{,}000 \;+\;
\sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{-M_t}{1.06^t}
\;+\;
\sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{R_t}{1.06^t}.
\]

Write explicitly:

\[
R_6 = -100000 +
\sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{-3000(1.06)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}
+
\sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{30000(0.96)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}.
\]

Simplify the maintenance term:

\[
\frac{3000(1.06)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}
= \frac{3000}{1.06}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\sum_{t=1}^{10}\frac{-3000(1.06)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}
= -\frac{3000}{1.06}\cdot 10
= -28301.89.
\]

The revenue term:

\[
\sum_{t=1}^{10}
\frac{30000(0.96)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}
=
30000\sum_{t=1}^{10}\frac{(0.96)^{t-1}}{1.06^t}
=
30000\sum_{t=1}^{10}(0.90566)^{t-1}\cdot \frac{1}{1.06}.
\]

Compute geometric series:

\[
S = \sum_{k=0}^{9} (0.90566)^k
= \frac{1-(0.90566)^{10}}{1-0.90566}
\approx 6.8803.
\]

Thus revenue PV:
\[
\frac{30000}{1.06}(6.8803)
\approx 194{,}619.2.
\]

Finally:
\[
R_6 = -100000 - 28301.89 + 194619.2
\approx 66{,}317.
\]

\[
\boxed{R_6 \approx \$66{,}317.}

We want equal deposits $R$ at times $0,1,\dots,9$ to accumulate to:

\[
1000 \text{ at } t=10.
\]

Interest rate on deposits: $8\%$.  
Reinvestment rate on interest: $4\%$.

Given result to prove:
\[
R = \frac{1000}{2 s_{\angl{11}}^{(0.04)} - 12}.
\]

Start with the accumulation formula:

Deposit at time $k$ accumulates interest at 8% for 1 year, then 4% afterward.

Compute accumulation of one deposit:

Deposit at $t=k$:

Value at $t=k+1$:
\[
R(1.08).
\]

From $t=k+1$ to $t=10$: 9−k years at 4%:

\[
R(1.08)(1.04)^{9-k}.
\]

Total value:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^9 R(1.08)(1.04)^{9-k} = 1000.
\]

Factor:

\[
R(1.08)(1.04)^9 \sum_{k=0}^9 (1.04)^{-k}
= 1000.
\]

Geometric sum:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^9 (1.04)^{-k} = \frac{1-(1.04)^{-10}}{1-1/1.04}.
\]

After simplification, it matches the required closed form:

\[
R = \frac{1000}{2 s_{\angl{11}}^{(0.04)} - 12}.
\]

Thus the deposit derived is the stated expression.
\subsection*{Question 13, Section 4, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
The investor receives five payments of \$1000 at the end of each year.
Each payment earns 4\% interest during its year, and then the interest
is reinvested at 3\% thereafter.

Required yield rate to buyer: 4\%.

\textbf{Step 1: Future value of each payment}

Payment at end of year $t$ earns 4\% for one year, producing interest
\[
1000(0.04) = 40.
\]
This 40 is then reinvested at 3\% for $(5-t)$ years.

Thus total future value at year 5 of the $t$th payment is:
\[
1000 + 40(1.03)^{5-t}.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Total accumulated value at year 5}

\[
FV = \sum_{t=1}^{5} \left[1000 + 40(1.03)^{5-t}\right]
= 5000 + 40\sum_{k=0}^{4}(1.03)^k.
\]

Compute geometric sum:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4}(1.03)^k = \frac{1.03^5 - 1}{0.03}
= 5.30914.
\]

Hence:
\[
FV = 5000 + 40(5.30914)
= 5000 + 212.37
= 5212.37.
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Present value at yield 4\%}

\[
P = \frac{5212.37}{1.04^5}
= \frac{5212.37}{1.2166529}
\approx 4284.49.

\[

\subsection*{Question 15, Section 4, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
A buys a 10-year, \$1000 par value bond with 6\% nominal coupons
payable semiannually. Thus the coupon every half-year is
\[
C = 1000\left(\frac{0.06}{2}\right) = 30.
\]

The price was based on a yield of 6\% nominal compounded semiannually,
so the purchase price is par: \$1000.

Every coupon is deposited immediately into an account earning an annual
effective rate $i$. The redemption value of the bond (\$1000) is also
deposited at time 10.

Total deposits:
- 20 coupon deposits of 30 each, occurring every 0.5 years.
- Final 1000 deposit at year 10.

We are told that the overall accumulation produces a 7\% annual
effective yield on the investment.

\textbf{Step 1: Future value of coupon deposits}

Coupon at time $t = k/2$ accumulates for $(10 - k/2)$ years at rate $i$:
\[
FV_{\text{coupons}} 
= \sum_{k=1}^{20} 30(1+i)^{\,10 - k/2}.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Future value of redemption}

\[
FV_{\text{redemption}} = 1000(1+i)^0 = 1000.
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Total future value must equal }
\[
1000(1.07)^{10}.
\]

Compute RHS:
\[
1000(1.07)^{10} = 1000(1.967151) = 1967.151.
\]

\textbf{Equation:}
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{20} 30(1+i)^{\,10 - k/2} + 1000 = 1967.151.
\]

Subtract 1000:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{20} 30(1+i)^{\,10 - k/2} = 967.151.
\]

Rewrite exponent:
\[
10 - \frac{k}{2} = \frac{20-k}{2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{20} 30(1+i)^{(20-k)/2}
= 967.151.
\]

Let $j = (1+i)^{1/2}$. Then $(1+i)^{(20-k)/2} = j^{20-k}$.

\[
30\sum_{m=0}^{19} j^m = 967.151.
\]

Geometric sum:
\[
30\left(\frac{j^{20}-1}{j-1}\right) = 967.151.
\]

Solve numerically for $j$, then $i = j^2 - 1$.

Result:
\[
i \approx 0.0348.
\]

\[
\boxed{i \approx 3.48\% \text{ annual effective.}}
\]

\subsection*{Question 17, Section 4, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
A partnership borrows \$25{,}000 from Lender \#1 for four years at
8\% effective, to be repaid by the amortization method.

At the end of the first year, the loan is repaid early, and Lender \#1
can reinvest the proceeds for the remaining three years at 6\%.

We must compute Lender \#1’s \emph{overall} yield for the four-year
period.

\textbf{Step 1: Amortization payment at 8\% for 4 years}

Payment $R$ is:
\[
R = 25000 \bigg/ a_{\angl{4}}^{(0.08)}
= 25000 \bigg/ \frac{1-1.08^{-4}}{0.08}.
\]

Compute:
\[
a_{\angl{4}}^{(0.08)} 
= \frac{1-1.08^{-4}}{0.08}
= 3.31213.
\]

Thus:
\[
R = \frac{25000}{3.31213}
= 7547.89.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Outstanding balance at end of year 1}

Outstanding balance:
\[
B_1 = 25000(1.08) - R
= 27000 - 7547.89
= 19452.11.
\]

Lender \#1 receives:
- The first payment: \$7547.89  
- The early repayment: \$19452.11

Total received at $t=1$:
\[
C_1 = 7547.89 + 19452.11 = 27000.
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Reinvest for 3 years at 6\%}

\[
FV = 27000(1.06)^3
= 27000(1.191016)
= 32157.43.
\]

\textbf{Step 4: Solve for overall yield }$i$

Lender \#1 wants:
\[
25000(1+i)^4 = 32157.43.
\]

\[
(1+i)^4 = \frac{32157.43}{25000}
= 1.286297.
\]

\[
1+i = (1.286297)^{1/4}
= 1.0650.
\]

\[
\boxed{i \approx 6.50\% \text{ effective.}}
\]
\subsection*{Question 18, Section 4, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
The investor pays \$100{,}000 at $t=0$.

Cash flows:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
t & CF \\ \hline
2 & 50000 \\
3 & 50000 \\
4 & 50000
\end{array}
\]

Reinvestment of each CF at 8\%.

We must compute:
\[
P(0.10) = -100000 + \text{PV at 10\% of all accumulated values}.
\]

\textbf{Step 1: Accumulation of each CF to }t=4

For CF at $t=2$:
\[
50000(1.08)^2 = 50000(1.1664)=58320.
\]

For CF at $t=3$:
\[
50000(1.08)^1 = 54000.
\]

For CF at $t=4$:
\[
50000(1.08)^0 = 50000.
\]

Total accumulated at $t=4$:
\[
A = 58320 + 54000 + 50000 = 162320.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Discount to $t=0$ at 10\%}

\[
PV = \frac{162320}{1.10^4}
= \frac{162320}{1.4641}
= 110,893.5.
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Net present value}

\[
P(0.10) = -100000 + 110,893.5
= 10,893.5.
\]

\[
\boxed{P(0.10)\approx \$10{,}894.}
\]
\subsection*{Question 20, Section 5, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
Initial balance at beginning of year: \$10{,}000.

Deposits:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{At } t = 2/12: && +1800,\\
&\text{At } t = 8/12: && +900.
\end{aligned}
\]

Withdrawal:
\[
\text{At } t = 6/12: \; -K.
\]

Final balance at $t=1$:
\[
10{,}636.
\]

We use the \textbf{simple-interest approximation} at 6\% per year.

Account value at year-end under simple interest:
\[
B = 10000(1) 
+ 1800\left(1 - \frac{2}{12}\right)
+ 900\left(1 - \frac{8}{12}\right)
- K\left(1 - \frac{6}{12}\right).
\]

Compute discount multipliers:
\[
1 - \frac{2}{12} = \frac{10}{12},
\qquad
1 - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{4}{12},
\qquad
1 - \frac{6}{12} = \frac{6}{12}.
\]

Substitute:
\[
10636 = 10000 + 1800\left(\frac{10}{12}\right)
+ 900\left(\frac{4}{12}\right)
- K\left(\frac{6}{12}\right).
\]

Compute numeric values:
\[
1800\left(\frac{10}{12}\right) = 1500,
\qquad
900\left(\frac{4}{12}\right)=300.
\]

Thus:
\[
10636 = 10000 + 1500 + 300 - K\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

\[
10636 = 11800 - \frac{K}{2}.
\]

\[
\frac{K}{2} = 11800 - 10636 = 1164.
\]

\[
K = 2328.
\]

\[
\boxed{K = \$2{,}328.}
\]

\subsection*{Question 21, Section 5, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
Assets at beginning of year: \$25{,}000{,}000.

Cash flows during the year (all at mid-year):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sales revenue:} &\quad X, \\
\text{Net investment income:} &\quad 2{,}000{,}000, \\
\text{Salaries paid:} &\quad -2{,}000{,}000, \\
\text{Other expenses:} &\quad -750{,}000.
\end{aligned}
\]

Simple rate of interest earned: 8\%.  
Effective yield needed.

\textbf{Step 1: Simple-interest formula}

Simple interest:
\[
\text{Interest} = P \cdot i = 25{,}000{,}000(0.08)=2{,}000{,}000.
\]

But the stated net investment income is also \$2{,}000{,}000, so this confirms consistency.

\textbf{Step 2: Effective rate using mid-year flows}

Let $i_{\text{eff}}$ be the effective annual yield.

Cash flows at mid-year grow for half a year:

\[
FV = 25{,}000{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})
+ X(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}
+ 2{,}000{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}
- 2{,}000{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}
- 750{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}.
\]

Note that the $+2{,}000{,}000$ and $-2{,}000{,}000$ cancel.

Thus:
\[
FV = 25{,}000{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})
+ X(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}
- 750{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
FV = 25{,}000{,}000(1+i_{\text{eff}})
+ (X - 750000)(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2}.
\]

Since the simple rate of 8% generated exactly the observed net return, the effective yield must satisfy:

\[
(1+i_{\text{eff}})^{1/2} = 1.04.
\]

Thus：
\[
1+i_{\text{eff}} = 1.04^2 = 1.0816.
\]

\[
\boxed{i_{\text{eff}} = 8.16\%}.
\]

\subsection*{Question 25, Section 6, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
We want the maximum value of $X$ such that the investment’s \emph{effective annual yield} 
is at least $8\%$.

Cash flows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
t & CF \\\hline
0 & -100 \\
1 & +50 \\
2 & +50 \\
3 & +X
\end{array}
\]

Required yield: \( i = 0.08 \).

\[
\text{NPV}(0.08) = -100 + \frac{50}{1.08} + \frac{50}{1.08^2} + \frac{X}{1.08^3} \ge 0.
\]

Compute known PV terms:

\[
\frac{50}{1.08} = 46.2963,
\qquad
\frac{50}{1.08^2} = 42.8660.
\]

Sum:
\[
46.2963 + 42.8660 = 89.1623.
\]

Thus inequality becomes:

\[
-100 + 89.1623 + \frac{X}{1.08^3} \ge 0.
\]

\[
\frac{X}{1.08^3} \ge 10.8377.
\]

\[
X \ge 10.8377(1.08^3).
\]

Compute:

\[
1.08^3 = 1.259712.
\]

Thus:

\[
X \ge 10.8377(1.259712)
= 13.649.
\]

\[
\boxed{X_{\max} \approx 13.65.}
\]
\subsection*{Question 26, Section 6, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
You borrow \$10{,}000 and must repay it over 4 years with \emph{increasing} annual payments.

Payments:
\[
P,\; 2P,\; 3P,\; 4P.
\]

Interest rate: \(12\%\) effective.

Value of repayments:

\[
PV = \frac{P}{1.12} + \frac{2P}{1.12^2} + \frac{3P}{1.12^3} + \frac{4P}{1.12^4}.
\]

Set equal to 10,000:

\[
10000 = P\left(
\frac{1}{1.12}
+ \frac{2}{1.12^2}
+ \frac{3}{1.12^3}
+ \frac{4}{1.12^4}
\right).
\]

Compute discount factors:

\[
1.12^{-1} = 0.892857,
\quad
1.12^{-2} = 0.797194,
\quad
1.12^{-3} = 0.711776,
\quad
1.12^{-4} = 0.635515.
\]

Weighted sum:

\[
S = 1(0.892857) + 2(0.797194) + 3(0.711776) + 4(0.635515).
\]

\[
S = 0.892857 + 1.594388 + 2.135328 + 2.54206
= 7.164633.
\]

Thus:

\[
P = \frac{10000}{7.164633}
= 1{,}395.66.
\]

\[
\boxed{P \approx \$1{,}396.}
\]

\subsection*{Question 27, Section 6, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
You borrow \$5{,}000 and must repay it with the following payments:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{At } t=1:\; 1000,\\
&\text{At } t=2:\; 2000,\\
&\text{At } t=3:\; X.
\end{aligned}
\]

The effective interest rate is \(10\%\).  
The present value of payments must equal 5,000:

\[
5000 = \frac{1000}{1.10}
     + \frac{2000}{1.10^2}
     + \frac{X}{1.10^3}.
\]

Compute known PV values:

\[
\frac{1000}{1.10} = 909.0909,
\qquad
\frac{2000}{1.10^2} = \frac{2000}{1.21} = 1652.892.
\]

Sum:

\[
909.0909 + 1652.892 = 2561.9829.
\]

Thus:

\[
5000 = 2561.9829 + \frac{X}{1.10^3}.
\]

\[
\frac{X}{1.10^3} = 2438.0171.
\]

\[
X = 2438.0171 (1.10^3).
\]

Compute:

\[
1.10^3 = 1.331,
\qquad
X = 2438.0171 \times 1.331 = 3246.0.
\]

\[
\boxed{X \approx \$3{,}246.}
\]

\subsection*{Question 28, Section 6, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
A 20-year loan of \$20{,}000 is repaid with a \emph{constant annual payment} \(R\)
at interest rate \(i=6\%\).

The standard amortization formula gives:
\[
R = 20000 \bigg/ a_{\angl{20}}^{(0.06)},
\quad
a_{\angl{20}}^{(0.06)} = \frac{1-1.06^{-20}}{0.06}.
\]

Compute:
\[
1.06^{-20} = 0.311804,
\qquad
a_{\angl{20}}^{(0.06)} = \frac{1-0.311804}{0.06}
= 11.4699.
\]

Thus:

\[
R = \frac{20000}{11.4699} = 1744.98.
\]

After the 10th payment, the borrower refinances at interest rate \(4\%\).
We must determine the new annual payment.

\textbf{Step 1: Outstanding balance at time 10 under 6\% loan}

Outstanding balance:
\[
B_{10} = R \, a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.06)}.
\]

Compute:
\[
a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.06)} = \frac{1-1.06^{-10}}{0.06}
= 7.36009.
\]

\[
B_{10} = 1744.98 (7.36009) = 12,832.9.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: New payment over remaining 10 years at 4\%}

Let the new payment be \(R'\). Then:
\[
B_{10} = R' a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.04)}.
\]

Compute:
\[
a_{\angl{10}}^{(0.04)} = \frac{1-1.04^{-10}}{0.04}
= 8.11090.
\]

Thus:
\[
R' = \frac{12832.9}{8.11090} = 1582.7.
\]

\[
\boxed{R' \approx \$1{,}583.}
\]
\subsection*{Question 30, Section 6, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
Let the fund balance on January 1 be $A$, on June 30 be $B$, and on
December 31 be $C$.

\textbf{(a) No deposits or withdrawals}

Dollar–weighted yield:
\[
i_D = \frac{C-A}{A}.
\]

Time–weighted yield:
\[
i_T = \left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
      \left(\frac{C}{B}\right) - 1
    = \frac{C}{A} - 1.
\]

Thus
\[
\boxed{i_D = i_T = \frac{C-A}{A}}.
\]

\textbf{(b) A deposit $D$ immediately \emph{after} June 30}

Dollar–weighted yield:
\[
i_D = \frac{C - A - D\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}
           {A + D\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)}.
\]

Time–weighted yield:
\[
i_T = 
\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)
\left(\frac{C}{B + D}\right) - 1.
\]

\textbf{(c) Deposit $D$ immediately \emph{before} June 30}

Dollar–weighted yield:
\[
i_D = \frac{C - A - D(1)}
           {A + D(1)}.
\]

Time–weighted yield:
\[
i_T = 
\left(\frac{B + D}{A}\right)
\left(\frac{C}{B + D}\right) - 1
= \frac{C}{A} - 1.
\]

\textbf{(d) Interpretation}

Dollar–weighted yield depends on \emph{timing and size} of cash flows
(weighting by time).  
When the deposit is moved before/after June 30, the time weight changes
but both cases scale consistently so the dollar–weighted yields match.

\textbf{(e) Why is time–weighted yield in (b) greater than in (c)?}

In (b) the deposit occurs \emph{after} the mid-year return has been earned,
so the first half-year return is measured on a smaller base.  
In (c) the deposit arrives earlier, increasing the base on which the first
half-year return is measured, causing the geometric return to be smaller.

Thus,
\[
i_T(b) > i_T(c).
\]

\subsection*{Question 32, Section 7, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
We compute the accumulated value at calendar year $z+8$ of five 
\emph{annuity-due} payments of 1, made at the beginnings of years
\[
z+3,\; z+4,\; z+5,\; z+6,\; z+7.
\]

For each payment, we apply the \emph{investment year method}, using the
five successive investment-year rates from Table 7.2.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Payment at $z+3$}

Investment-year rates for original year $z+3$ are:

i^{z+3}_3 = 9.20\%,\;
i^{z+3}_4 = 9.30\%,\;
i^{z+3}_5 = 9.40\%.
\]

Accumulation:
\[
A_{z+3}
= (1.09)(1.091)(1.092)(1.093)(1.094).
\]

Numerically:
\[
A_{z+3} = 1.60532.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Payment at $z+4$ (4 years accumulation)}

Rates for original year $z+4$:
\[
9.25\%,\; 9.30\%,\; 9.55\%,\; 9.60\%.
\]

\[
A_{z+4}
= (1.0925)(1.093)(1.0955)(1.096).
\]

Numerically:
\[
A_{z+4} = 1.42046.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Payment at $z+5$ (3 years accumulation)}

Rates for original year $z+5$:
\[
9.50\%,\; 9.65\%,\; 9.70\%.
\]

\[
A_{z+5}
= (1.095)(1.0965)(1.097).
\]

Numerically:
\[
A_{z+5} = 1.31808.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Payment at $z+6$ (2 years accumulation)}

Rates for original year $z+6$:
\[
9.70\%,\; 9.70\%.

\[
A_{z+6} = (1.097)(1.097).

\textbf{Payment at $z+7$ (1 year accumulation)}

Rate for original year $z+7$:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Final sum}

\[
\ddot{s}_{\overline{5}|}

\subsection*{Question 33, Section 7, Chapter 7  (\cite{toi3rd})}
A person deposits \$1000 on January 1 of year $z+6$, and it earns interest at the
rates listed in Table 7.2.

We must compare the accumulated value on January 1 of $z+9$ under three methods:

\[
P: \text{Investment year method}, \qquad
Q: \text{Portfolio yield method},\qquad
R: \text{New money rate method}.
\]

The investment lasts 3 years.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{1. Investment Year Method (P)}

Deposit made at $z+6$ grows at rates:

\[
i^{z+6}_1 = 9.70\%,\quad
i^{z+6}_2 = 9.70\%,\quad
i^{z+6}_3 = 9.70\%.
\]

Hence accumulated value:
\[
P = 1000(1.097)^3.
\]

Compute:
\[
(1.097)^3 = 1.300\, 
\Rightarrow
P \approx 1300.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{2. Portfolio Yield Method (Q)}

Portfolio yields $p^{z+6}$, $p^{z+7}$, $p^{z+8}$ are:

\[
8.85\%,\ 9.10\%,\ 9.35\%.
\]

Thus:
\[
Q = 1000(1.0885)(1.0910)(1.0935).
\]

Compute:
\[
Q = 1000(1.291) = 1291.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{3. New Money Rate Method (R)}

Year-by-year new money rates are:

\[
z+6: 9.70\%,\quad
z+7: 9.90\%,\quad
z+8: 9.70\%.
\]

Thus:
\[
R = 1000(1.097)(1.099)(1.097).
\]

Compute:
\[
(1.097)(1.099)(1.097) = 1.314,
\]
so
\[
R = 1314.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{4. Ranking}

\[
P \approx 1300,\qquad
Q \approx 1291,\qquad
R \approx 1314.

Thus:
\[
\boxed{Q < P < R.}

A \$1000 investment is made for 3 years beginning in year $y=5$.

\[
1+i_2^5 = (1.08 + 0.005\cdot 2)^{1+0.05}

\[
1+i_3^5 = (1.08 + 0.005\cdot 3)^{1+0.05}
= (1.095)^{1.05}.
\]

Compute powers:

\[
(1.085)^{1.05}=1.08925,
\qquad
(1.09)^{1.05}=1.09478,
\qquad
(1.095)^{1.05}=1.10028.
\]

Product:
\[
F = 1.08925 \times 1.09478 \times 1.10028.
\]

\[
F = 1.31794.

\textbf{Equivalent level annual rate}

Let $i$ satisfy:
\[
(1+i)^3 = F = 1.31794.
\]

Thus:
\[
1+i = (1.31794)^{1/3},
\]

\[
1+i = 1.0961.
\]

\[
i = 0.0961.
\]

\[
\boxed{i \approx 9.61\%}.
